## 📂 Example Use Cases

### 🍽 Recipes
You save recipes like “chocolate cake,” “pasta salad,” or “quick snacks.” Later, when you search “easy desserts,” it shows all the recipes you saved — even if you didn’t type “chocolate cake” exactly!

### 📚 Work or Study Notes
You write notes like “React hooks best practices” or “exam dates for next week.” Later, when you search “React tips” or “important dates,” it finds your notes instantly without scrolling through everything!

### 🏏 Sports Lovers
You save articles or stats like “Asia Cup squad,” “Siraj’s 6-wicket haul,” or “cricket world cup finals.” When you search “latest cricket news,” it brings up related content you saved before — even if you don’t remember the exact title!

### 🎵 Music Lovers
You keep track of songs like “Born to Shine” or “Ishq Di.” Later, when you search “uplifting Punjabi songs,” it shows your favorites without needing the exact title!

### ✈️ Travel or Hobbies
You save travel plans, packing lists, or hobby ideas like “trip to Manali” or “guitar practice schedule.” Later, you search “weekend trips” or “music practice” and it quickly brings up what you need!

### 💡 Smart Summaries
The AI doesn’t just find your saved notes — it understands the context and even summarizes them for you, just like a chatbot! So, if you search “React tips,” it can give you a short summary with key points, helping you review faster without reading everything.
